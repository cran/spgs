\title{
Disambiguate a Nucleic Sequence
}
\description{

Make a DNA/RNA sequence unambiguous by stripping out all symbols that do 
\bold{not} uniquely specify nucleic acids.  In other words, remove all symbols 
other than \code{a}'s, \code{c}'s, \code{g}'s, \code{t}'s or \code{u}'s from the 
sequence.
}
\usage{
\method{disambiguate}{default}(x, case=c("lower", "upper", "as is"), \dots)
\method{disambiguate}{SeqFastadna}(x, \dots)
\method{disambiguate}{list}(x, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A character vector, an object that can be coersed to a character vector or a 
  list of objects that canbe be converted to character vectors.  this argument 
  can also be a \code{SeqFastadna} object provided by the \pkg{seqinr} package.
}
\item{case}{
Determines how symbols in \code{x} should be treated before translating them 
into their complements. \dQuote{\code{lower}}, the default behaviour, converts 
all symbols to lowercase while \dQuote{\code{upper}} converts them to 
uppercase.  \dQuote{\code{as is}} allows the symbols to pass unchanged so that the case 
of each output symbol matches that of the corresponding input symbol.
}
\item{\dots}{
Arguments to be passed from or to other functions.
}
}
\details{
If \code{x} is a SeqFastadna object or a character vector in which each element 
is a single nucleobase, then it represents a single sequence. It will be made 
unambiguous and returned in the same form.

On the other hand, if \code{x} is a vector of character strings, each of which 
represents a nucleic sequence, then the result will bea a character vector in 
which each element contains the unambiguous sequence corresponding to the 
element in \code{x} as a character string.
}
\value{
According to the input \code{x}, a character vector, SeqFastadna object or list 
containing the  completely unambiguous sequence(s) in \code{x}.
