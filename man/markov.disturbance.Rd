\title{
Construct feasible Random Noise Generating a First-Order Markov Chain
}
\description{
Produces a sequence of random noise which would generate an observed sequence of
finite symbols provided that the sequence of symbols results from a first-order
Markov chain.
}
\usage{
markov.disturbance(x, chain = NULL, random = TRUE, bandwidth = 1, 
estimates = is.null(chain))
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A sequence of finite symbols represented  as a  character vector.
}
  \item{chain}{
A list containing two named components which specify a first-order Markov chain.
The \samp{trans.mat} component holds the stochastic transition matrix for the
chain while the \samp{stat.dist} component holds the stationary distribution of
the chain.  If not specified, \samp{chain} is estimated from \samp{x} using 
\code{\link{estimateMarkovChain}}.
}
  \item{random}{
This can be a logical value or a number in the range 0-1. If \samp{TRUE}, random
noise will be generated.  If \samp{FALSE}, the constant value 0.5 will be used
as the noise source.  If a value in the range 0-1 is specified, that value will
be used as a constant noise source.  the default value is \samp{TRUE}.
}
  \item{bandwidth}{
This value, which should be in the range 0-1, specifies the maximum peak-to-peak
bandwidth of the random noise generated.  The default value is 1.
}
  \item{estimates}{
A logical value specifying if the Markov chain estimates should be included in
the return.
}
}
\value{
If \samp{estimates} is \samp{TRUE}, returns a list containing the following components:

\item{disturbance}{the sequence of random noise as a numeric vector.}
\item{trans.mat}{The stochastic transition matrix estimated from x, if
\samp{chain} is NULL; otherwise a copy of \samp{trans.mat} component of
\samp{chain}.}
\item{stat.dist}{The stationary distribution estimated from x, if
\samp{chain} is NULL; otherwise a copy of the \samp{stat.dist} component of
\samp{chain}.}

Otherwise, if \samp{estimate} is \samp{FALSE}, returns the sequence of random
noise as a numeric vector.
