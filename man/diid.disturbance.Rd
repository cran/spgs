\title{
Construct feasible Random Noise Generating a Bernoulli Process
}
\description{
Produces a sequence of random noise which would generate an observed sequence of
finite symbols provided that the sequence of symbols results from a Bernoulli 
process.
}
\usage{
diid.disturbance(x, random = TRUE,  estimates = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A sequence of finite symbols represented  as a  character vector.
}
    \item{random}{This can be a logical value or a number in the range 0-1. If \samp{TRUE}, random
noise will be generated.  If \samp{FALSE}, the constant value 0.5 will be used
as the noise source.  If a value in the range 0-1 is specified, that value will
be used as a constant noise source.  the default value is \samp{TRUE}.
}
  \item{estimates}{
A logical value specifying if the distribution estimated for the Bernoulli process should be included in
the return.
}
}
\value{
If \samp{estimates} is \samp{TRUE}, returns a list containing the following components:

\item{disturbance}{the sequence of random noise as a numeric vector.}
\item{stat.dist}{The stationary distribution estimated from x.}

Otherwise, if \samp{estimate} is \samp{FALSE}, returns the sequence of random
noise as a numeric vector.
